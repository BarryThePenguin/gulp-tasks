## Who are Vision 100 IT?

Bold claims for a group that hasn’t introduced ourselves yet! Who are Vision 100 IT then?

We’re a team of passionate IT and web development engineers, ministry leaders and management professionals who voluntarily build, maintain, train and educate our clients in IT systems on the basis of years of collective knowledge gleaned from within the IT industry.

Vision 100 IT has now existed for over a decade, and has gradually built up a knowledge base of best practices and approaches for doing church IT *sustainably*. We are all about getting *and keeping* our clients on the web, in order to more effectively reach the lost and minister to the people in their congregations.
